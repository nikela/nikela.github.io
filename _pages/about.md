Welcome! I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Low Carbon and Sustainable Computing at the [School of Computing Science](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/) of the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk), a member of the [GLAsgow Systems Section](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/systems-section) and the [Low Carbon and Sustainable Computing Research Theme](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchthemes/lowcarbon). 

My research focuses on optimizing high-performance computing (HPC) systems to minimize environmental impact. This involves performance modeling, application optimization and co-design, and resource management strategies, with an emphasis on energy efficiency, low carbon footprint, and sustainability. I am particularly interested in applying these techniques to machine-learning workloads, and making AI sustainable. 

How to reach me
=====
I am excited to connect with anyone passionate about High-Performance Computing and Sustainable Computing! If you are
interested in discussing research, or exploring potential collaborations, feel free to reach out!

Send me an [email](mailto: nikela.papadopoulou@glasgow.ac.uk) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikelapapadopoulou).

If you are a student at the University of Glasgow, and you are considering a Level 4/MSc project in High-Performance
Computing or Sustainable Computing, please also share your background and interests. 

If you are considering a PhD, I am looking for motivated individuals and I am open to discussing research interests and
potential projects. Please include a brief overview of your research goals and relevant experience in your message.

are available through the School of Computing Scienece at the University of Glasgow. 

Short Bio
======
I received my Diploma (MEng) in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr) in 2012, from the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr), Greece. In 2017, I received my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the same university.

From 2012 to 2017, as a PhD student, I was a member of the [Computing Systems Laboratory](https://cslab.ece.ntua.gr) at ECE, NTUA. My PhD thesis, supervised by Georgios Goumas, focused on building accurate prediction models for the communication time of HPC applications at scale, to achieve better resource allocation and usage. During my PhD studies, I visited the MCS division of [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/mcs) in USA, as a research aide, and worked on UCX, a communication framework for high-bandwidth, low-latency networks.  

From 2017 to 2022, I was a researcher at the [Computing Systems Laboratory](http://cslab.ece.ntua.gr), and I participated in multiple research activities in the HPC domain, including several EU-funded projects (ACTiCLOUD, EuroEXA, HiDALGO, CYBELE, REGALE). . 

From 2022 to 2024, I was a post-doctoral researcher in the department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/cse/) at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se), Sweden, where I worked in the group led by Miquel Peric√†s on heterogeneous architectures and runtimes. I participated in the EU-funded projects eProcessor and EUPILOT.  

In January 2024, I joined the [School of Computing Science](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/) of the University of Glasgow as a Lecturer in Low Carbon and Sustainable Computing.
