Welcome! I am a post-doctoral researcher at the Computer Systems division of the [CSE](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/cse/) department of [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se) in Göteborg, Sweden. 

My research interests lie in the area of high-performance computing. Here is a non-exhaustive list:
- HPC application acceleration/optimization/deployment/tuning
- Performance modeling for HPC systems
- Programming models and runtime systems
- Resource management

I currently work mostly with the OpenMP runtime, aiming to improve application performance through locality. On the application side, I keep digging into widely-used computational kernels (dense and sparse), with a special interest in emerging and/or heterogeneous architectures.

How to reach me
=====
If you're as into High Performance Computing as I am, I would love to hear from you. Whether you're just looking for a friendly chat or are interested in exploring potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out to me. I'm always eager to connect with fellow researchers and share ideas.

Send me an [email](mailto: nikela@chalmers.se) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikelapapadopoulou) or [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/_nikela_).

Short Bio
======
I received my Diploma (MEng) in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr) in 2012, from the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr), Greece. In 2017, I received my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the same university.

From 2012 to 2017, as a PhD student, I was a member of the [Computing Systems Laboratory] (https://cslab.ece.ntua.gr) at ECE, NTUA. My PhD thesis, supervised by Georgios Goumas, focused on building accurate prediction models for the communication time of HPC applications at scale, to achieve better resource allocation and usage. During my PhD studies, I visited the MCS division of [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/mcs) in USA, as a research aide, and worked on UCX, a communication framework for high-bandwidth, low-latency networks.  

From 2017 to 2022, I was a researcher at the [Computing Systems Laboratory](http://cslab.ece.ntua.gr), and I participated in multiple research activities in the HPC domain, including several EU-funded projects. 

In 2022, I joined Chalmers as post-doctoral researcher in the department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/cse/), and I work in the group led by Miquel Pericàs.
